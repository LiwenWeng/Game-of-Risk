# Game-of-Risk

This game is a turn based game where the main objective is to survive/keep your company afloat.
You start with money and health, and have to balance the two while dealing with the daily events (that could be good or bad).
The events could range from an employee plugging in a USB that could either have a virus or be virus-free (lower chances of that obviously) to getting sued for leaking of PII.
You lose when your company runs out of money, but health is more for events and is reduced based on how you deal with them.
If you don't have health at the start of your turn, you can't make an action, and are forced to restore some health, which can leave you vulnerable to whatever event comes your way.
Vulnerabilities and risk is increased through events, and the higher your risk is, the more events can occur, further increasing it and increasing your amount of vulnerabilities.

What may be set later is multiple components to the player's company, each of which can gain a vulnerability due to an event and have to be scanned, and an item shop that shows up every other 'day' that the player can buy items, upgrades, or abilities from based on currency, and that's another way that the player will have to balance their cash, allowing you to increase your income by spending it.
